Iâ€™m tired of being alone
Sick of being single
I think I need me girl
I need a girl like
I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
Would you tremble, if I touched your lips?
I can be your hero, baby
I can kiss away the pain
I will stand by you forever
You can take my very breath away
All by myself
Don't wanna be, All by myself, Anymore
Cause you should be my Lady!
Baby! Listen to your heart, won't let you down
I've never felt so strong, Life can lead us to a happiness never ending
See you in your wedding dress
I can see you in your wedding dress
Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine
I don't care who you are, Where you're from, What you did, As long as you love me
Who you are, Where you're from, Don't care what you did, As long as you love me
Some people wait a lifetime, for a moment like this
Some people search forever, For that one special kiss
